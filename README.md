This repository contains the full computational workflow for multi-modal brain analysis, including:

1. Single-nucleus RNA-seq preprocessing and QC, clustering

2. Differential expression using Linear Mixed Models (LMM) and pseudobulk

3. Cell-type proportion analysis and compositional modeling (scCODA)

4. Co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA)

5. Cell-type label transfer with scANVI

6. Spatial deconvolution with Stereoscope (Visium)

7. Cell segmentation analysis on Xenium images

8. Xenium Neuronal celltype annotation
